The rest can be a total mess and you can still read it without problem. This is because the human mind doss not read every letter by itself, but the word as a whole."

    Ozymandias = 'I met a Traveller from an antique land\nWho said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone\nStand in the desart.  Near them, on the sand,\nHalf sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\nAnd wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\nTell that its sculptor well those passions read\nWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\nThe hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:\nAnd on the pedestal these words appear:\n"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:\nLook on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"\nNothing beside remains.  Round the decay\nOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bare\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away.'
